# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`.

### Changesets basics

A **changeset** is a piece of information about a change made to your project. It contains:

- The type of change (major, minor, or patch)
- A description of the change

### How to create a changeset

Run `bun run changeset` and follow the prompts.

### How to consume changesets

When you merge a PR with a changeset to `main`, the CI will:

1. Create a "Version Packages" PR with updated versions
2. When you merge that PR, it will automatically publish to npm
